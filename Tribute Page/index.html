                <h2> Early life</h2>
                <p> Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata was born to Nusserwanji and Jeevanbai Tata on 3 March 1839 in
                    Navsari,a city in the south Gujarat. His father, Nusserwanji, was the first businessman in a
                    family of Parsi Zoroastrian priests. He broke the tradition to become the first member of the
                    family to start a business. He started an export trading firm in Mumbai.</p>

                <p>Jamsetji Tata joined his father in Mumbai at the age of 14 and enrolled at the Elphinstone
                    College completing his education as a 'Green Scholar' (an equivalent of a graduate). He was
                    married to Hirabai Daboo while he was still a student. He graduated from college in 1858 and
                    joined his father's trading firm. It was a turbulent time to start a business as the Indian
                    Rebellion of 1857 had just been suppressed by the British government. Tata made many trips
                    abroad, mainly to England, America, Europe, China, and Japan to establish branches for his
                    father's business.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="business">
                <h2> Business</h2>
                <p>
                    Tata worked in his father's company until he was 29. He founded a trading company in 1868 with
                    INR21,000 capital (worth US$52 million in 2015 prices). He bought a bankrupt oil mill at
                    Chinchpokli in 1869 and converted it to a cotton mill, which he renamed as Alexandra Mill. He
                    sold the mill 2 years later for a profit. He set up another cotton mill at Nagpur in 1874, which
                    he named as "Empress Mill" when Queen Victoria was proclaimed as the Empress of India at 1st
                    January 1877.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He had four goals in life: setting up an iron and steel company, a world-class learning
                    institution, a unique hotel and a hydro-electric plant. Only the hotel became a reality during
                    his lifetime, with the inauguration of the Taj Mahal Hotel at Colaba waterfront in Mumbai on 3
                    December 1903 at the cost of INR11 million (worth INR11 billion in 2015 prices). At that time it
                    was the only hotel in India to have electricity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His successors' work led to the three remaining ideas being achieved:
                </p>


                <li> Tata Steel (formerly TISCO â€“ Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited) is Asia's first and
                    India's largest steel company. It became world's fifth largest steel company, after it
                    acquired Corus Group producing 28 million tonnes of steel annually.</li>
                <li>Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, the pre-eminent Indian institution for research and
                    education in Science and Engineering.</li>
                <li>Tata Hydroelectric Power Supply Company, renamed Tata Power Company Limited, currently
                    India's largest private electricity company with an installed generation capacity of over
                    8000MW.</li>

                <h2>Death</h2>
                <p>
                    While on a business trip in Germany in 1900, Tata became seriously ill. He died in Bad Nauheim
                    on 19 May 1904, and was buried in the Parsi burial ground in Brookwood Cemetery, Woking,
                    England.

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Tata's iron and steel plant was set up at Sakchi village in Jharkhand. The village grew into a
                    town and the railway station there was named Tatanagar. Now, it is a bustling metropolis known
                    as Jamshedpur in Jharkhand, named in his honour.
                </p>
                <p>The old village of Sakchi (now urbanised) now exists within the city of Jamshedpur. </p>

                <p>Tata became the founding member of the Tata family.</p>
